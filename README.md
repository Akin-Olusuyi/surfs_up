- The average temprature in June from our data set is about 75 degrees compared to 71 degrees in December.
- The minimum temprature in December can be as low as 69 degrees whereas, in June the temperature could be as low as 64 degrees
- Looking at our summary statistics we can also say that, majority of the time, at least 75% of the time the weather in June will be around 77 degrees or higher and for December it will be 74 degrees or higher.
